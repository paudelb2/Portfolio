              <p>As a recent graduate student in Cyber Security Engineering, my journey into the world of technology started from a young age with a simple fascination for computers. This early interest has blossomed into a deep commitment to a career in cybersecurity. I'm captivated by the ever-evolving tech landscape and the growing challenges posed by cyber threats. What excites me most is the opportunity to tackle these threats, solve complex security problems, and protect important information. I aspire to use my skills in a role where I can keep learning, make a meaningful impact, and help advance cybersecurity. For me, this field is not just a career choiceâ€”it's a way to satisfy my curiosity and make a real difference in our increasingly digital world.
